# BEREKETBIRHANU-PORTFOLIO
this website is build for introducing myself for people who are intersted to work with me.
anyone who is intersted to work with me this wibsite will be a great reference to know me 
better and get info what i am capable of

to build this website i used the following technologies

for front end(which for know it is the only avaliable)

                    1.HTML5
                    2.CSS3
                    3.font awesome icons

when i work on HTML part i try to use almost all the html best practices like

                  a.i used nav tag for the navigation bar

                  b.aside tag for the side bar of my page

                  c.header tag for my header section

                  d.footer for my footer part of the portfolio

                  e.i try to comment each and every section of the code

when i style with css i also use the following properties and methdologies

                a.i use animations

                b.flex for example in services section 

                c.grid i can say almost 80% of the projects are built using grid and i think i am more 

                  more comfortable to wotk with Grid

                d.transformation whrn hover and other properties are add mostly in
                
                            -services
                            
                            -projects
                            
                            -social media links 
                            
                            -blogs are some of the exhibits
   
   And also this software is fully functional on both screen sizes which means small and big screens
   
   and i hope the code will descripe more how it really constructed
   
   finally i want to mention how i really build this website
   
       1.Basically i took ultimate zero to mastry HTML and CSS web development course
             
             -It helped me to fully understad how HTML  and css really works 
             
             -And it helped me how to handle projects by making me to work on some projects
             
              like tea station and tour guide projects were some of the projects i worked
